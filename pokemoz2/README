1) Change the path for ozc and ozengin wich is in the "makefile" and is named as "CHEMIN"
2) Compile the project tanks to the shell command : make
3) To have an exemple of the project you can also use the shell command : make exemple
4) Else you have to have the shell command : ozengine Game.ozf --mapFile 'name_of_the_file_for_pickle.txt' --probability number_between_0_and_1 --speed number_between_0_and_10 --(no)autofight  --(no)auto 

	-> mapFile is by default map.txt
	-> probability is the probability of fighting a wild pokemon on a grass cell
	-> speed is the game speed 
	-> autofight can take 3 options
 			fight where we fight automatically 
			runaway where we run all the time 
			you where you are master of your choice
	-> if auto is set then all perso move intelligently
	   if noauto is set we can move the perso by ourselves
